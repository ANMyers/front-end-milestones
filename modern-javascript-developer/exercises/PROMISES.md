# Acme Explosives

You're going to be working on a group project to refactor an small app that uses jQuery and XHRs with callbacks to use promises instead.

> **Instructor Suggestion:** 
> Use Github Classroom to create a new team project with something like [this repository](https://github.com/chortlehoort/exercise-promises) and the boilerplate. Break the students up into groups, and then send them the link to the group assignment. Each team will create their own team for the exercise, and each teammate will join the team and instantly be added as collaborators to it.
