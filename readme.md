#Mastery Learning

Welcome to an experiment in education. Learning software development isn't ike learning anything else , so we're not going to treat it like anything else. This is likely going to be a very different experience from your high school chem class or your college into to philosophy.

###So, why do things this way?
 First, and most importantly, in software development, each concept builds upon the previous concept, so absolute mastery of each concept is necessary bfore moving on. Second, teaching adults over the course of 6 months is a different animal than teaching children or 4 year degrees, it makes sense to teach it accordingly.

###Here are some primary differences:

Traditional Education Vs. Mastery Learning

learning on a schedule with a syllabus, regardless of student understanding
vs.
individualized progress and flexible class timing aimed at 100% of students achieving 100% mastery

all students work on the same material at the same time
vs.
students work through material at their own pace

teacher takes responsibility for keeping the class on schedule and for finishing the material by the end of the course
vs.
Instructor will make sure that all material has been  presented by the end of the class, but individual students are responsible for their own progress through the material

##What responsibilities are on the instsructor?
1. The instructor will present all material necessary to build a capstone by the end of the course.
1. The instructor will make sure all student questions are answered. Even the dumb ones. (questions, not students)
Bottom Line: We will give you all of the ingredients, but it's up to you tobake the cake.

##What responsibilities are on the student?
1. In short, show up to class, participate in class discussions and group projects, complete the exercises for each  milestone, the quiz for each milestone, and top it all off with a capstone project. Timing is felxible, if  you need a little more time to completely understnad a topic, take some time, ask for help and fill in any gaps in your understanding.
1. Ask questions! Even if the question is a "huh, I don't know where to start," it is absolutely imperative that students take responsibility for their own understanding and clarify any questions right away.
1. Make sure you are putting in the time and effort to reach success. Some people will not need to work outside of class, some people will. Figure out which group you belong in, or go ahead and hedge your bets and put in the extra work.
1. Work through the exercises for each milestone before you attempt the quiz. Skipping ahead to the quiz is the best way to cheat yourself out of understanding.
1. 
The Bottom Line: Take responsibility for your own learning. Your level of success is completely up to  you.
