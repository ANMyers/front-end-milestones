# Team Challenges

## Challenge \#1

Create a page that contains a text area and a button labeled *Create*.

##Challenge \#2

In HTML, create 3 divs
Give each div a background color
When one of the three divs is clicked do the following:
Give the selected/clicked div a border to indicate it has been selected
Reveal a form with an input box and a button
The user should now be able to enter a color value in the input field.  When the corresponding button is clicked, the currently selected div should change its background color to the color value the user entered in the input box.

Finish in under 3 hours? Figure out how to do the same with jQuery.

When the button is clicked, make the div double in size, and change the color from red to blue.
After 3 seconds, make the div revert to its original size and color.
