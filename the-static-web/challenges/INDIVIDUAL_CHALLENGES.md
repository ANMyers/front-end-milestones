# Challenge \#1

Create a form that has a range input, and a number input, both with the same values for min, max, and default. When the user changes the value on the range input, the value of the number input should match. The opposite should be true. The values of the two inputs should always be synchronized.

# Challenge \#2: Interactive navigation bar

Create a navigation bar out of an unordered list element, and add the following interactivity.

1. When the user hovers over one of the links, the color of the text should change.
1. When the user hovers over one of the links, the background color of the element that contains the link should change.
1. When the user clicks on one of the links, the element that contains the link should grow in size by 5px on the left and right.

# Challenge \#3: Sticky navigation bar

You will learn more about how to do this in CSS102, but if you want a challenge now, create a web page that has a navigation bar and plenty of articles so that the content goes well below the fold (fancy term for the amount of real estate that exists when the user first loads the page).

When the user scrolls now to read the rest of the content, the navigation bar should remain at the top of the page, always visible, no matter how far down the user scrolls.

## Music History Part 3

### Create a new branch

`git checkout -b version3`

### Requirements

Using your new CSS skills, you'll build even better looking music history pages.

1. Use the Flexible Layout Box model to ensure that both the form section and the content section are the same height.
1. The entire container for the even songs (plus its details) should have a background color of Sea Shell (SeaShell or \#FFF5EE)
1. The entire container for the odd songs (plus its details) should have a background color of Mint Cream (MintCream or \#F5FFFA)
1. The first song container should have bold text.
1. Set the navigation bar's position so that it's always on the top of the page, even if you scroll down. To ensure this works, you can just add some div tags at the bottom of the page that add enough text that would force you to scroll the browser.

### Merging

Remember to merge the `version3` branch back into `master` when you're done.
