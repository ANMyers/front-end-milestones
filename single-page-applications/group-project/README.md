# Chatty

## Requirements

Your group project will be building your own, very basic, version of Slack. You will be using event handlers, IIFEs, DOM manipulation, CSS manipulation, and XHRs to complete your mission.

Once the milestone is nearing completion, you will receive a Github Classroom link from your instructor. All the instructions will be in the README that gets created for you.
