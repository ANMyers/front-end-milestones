# Back to the Future of JavaScript

Today we're going to rebuild a very basic RequireJS application written with ECMAScript 5 syntax, into ECMAScript6 syntax! It's also going to be written in Angular. You'll be connecting to Firebase. It will be visually structured with Bootstrap.

Clone the [Back to the Future](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/back-to-the-future) repository. Then follow the instruction in the README.

# Resources

[Angular RequireJS Seed](https://github.com/tnajdek/angular-requirejs-seed/) - This was the inspiration for the basic plan of this application.

# Challenge \#1

Rebuild this project again, but with Browserify instead of RequireJS.
